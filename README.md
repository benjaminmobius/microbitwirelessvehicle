# microbitwirelessvehicle
Microbit code to move a microbit vehicle remotely using a radio connection with a second microbit.

This program allows you to control a microbit-based vehicle with a second microbit remote controller over radio.

Whenever you press a key on the remote controller (which is itself a microbit) this key is converted into a number which is sent wirelessly to the microbit in the vehicle.

Before using the program choose the same radiogroup on both devices.

- The button A moves the vehicle forward.
- The button B moves it backwards.
- Tilting the controller to the right (left) makes the vehicle do a right-turn (left-turn).
